Neural Networks with Python

A collection of neural network implementations, experiments, and learning notes using Python, NumPy, and machine learning frameworks. This repository is designed for learning, experimenting, and understanding how neural networks work — from basic perceptrons to deep learning models.

🚀 Features

Implementations of fundamental neural network architectures:

Perceptron

Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM/GRU)

Step-by-step model building using NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

Hands-on experiments with datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, custom datasets)

Visualization of training metrics (loss, accuracy, confusion matrix)

Jupyter notebooks for easy exploration
